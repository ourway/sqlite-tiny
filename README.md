# sqlite-tiny
My first attemp to write a sqlite3 clone.  It's just an experimental attempt to understand RDBMS. Please never use it in any production.


## TODOs
- [x] Prepare basic structure of project
- [ ] Find a good Unit Testing framework for C
- [ ] Learn how to use `getline`


## Other stuff
- Requirements:
Sqlite-tiny requires `clang` to compile, although it's completely ok to compile it with
`gcc`.

- Compiling:
```bash
make
```

- Running:
```bash
./bin/database
```
- Feel free to ask me anything.  Drop me a mail at: `rodmena@me.com`
