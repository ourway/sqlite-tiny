# sqlite-tiny
My first attemp to write a sqlite3 clone.  It's just an experimental attempt to understand RDBMS. Please never use it in any production.

## Requirements:
Sqlite-tiny requires `clang` to compile, although it's completely ok to compile it with
`gcc`.

## Compiling:
```bash
make
```

## Running:
```bash
./bin/database
```
